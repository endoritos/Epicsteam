# EpicSite
Just like Epic Games and Steam,

this is a website that lets you chat with friends and add your games to it. The backend is powered by a robust MySQL database, meticulously designed to manage relationships between users and their games. You can choose to make your game public or private, allowing for a customizable social experience.

The built-in API offers seamless integration with your games, enabling real-time interactions and calls to the website. You can view leaderboards and track achievements, competing with friends and strangers alike. My sophisticated database architecture ensures secure storage and efficient retrieval of user information and game data, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.Just like Epic Games and Steam, this is a website that lets you chat with friends and add your games to it.
